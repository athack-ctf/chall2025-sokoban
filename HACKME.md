Roger is supposed to work on his quantum chromodynamics assignment for tomorrow... but instead he decided to solve Sokoban games.
What a waste of time, right? I hope his supervisor never finds out.


NOTE:
- `@` player
- `$` box
- `.` goal
- `#` wall
- `*` box on goal
- `+` player on goal

For each puzzle, the answer is expected as a sequence of move, such as `urRlddDlLuuuL` for instance.
u, d, l, r = up, down, left, right
UPPERCASE = push a box, lowercase = move
