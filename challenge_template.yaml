    Roger is supposed to work on his quantum chromodynamics assignment for tomorrow... but instead he decided to solve Sokoban games.
    What a waste of time, right? I hope his supervisor never finds out.


    NOTE:
    - `@` player
    - `$` box
    - `.` goal
    - `#` wall
    - `*` box on goal
    - `+` player on goal

    For each puzzle, the answer is expected as a sequence of move, such as `urRlddDlLuuuL` for instance.
    u, d, l, r = up, down, left, right
    UPPERCASE = push a box, lowercase = move

    Solutions are not unique.
